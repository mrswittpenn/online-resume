    <h3>About Me:</h3> 
    <p>I am a SAHM with a knack for starting too many project and having too many interests. I have three and a half children who take up most of my awake time in the very best way. I love finding new ways to streamline processes, delegate tasks, and problems solve which has worked out very well in my part time work as an Airbnb Host as well as my current pursuit of becoming a full-stack web developer.
